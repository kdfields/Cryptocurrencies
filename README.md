# Cryptocurrencies
#### Module 19 Challenge


## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this anlaysis is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies to help uncover trends in order to pitch and convince Accountability Accounting to invest in cryptocurrencies.  The cryptocurrencies will be clustered in groups according to their features, and a report will be generated for use in the sales pitch.

The technical analysis will consist of 4 parts:
+ Preprocessing the data for Principal Component Analysis **(PCA)**,
+ Reducing the data dimension using PCA,
+ Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
+ Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

### Resouces
